# github-action-push-to-another-repository

Modified by https://github.com/PhilGale92 to add a new 'do-not-delete-list-file' prop.
This references to a user-supplied .txt file where each new line is a path that should be preserved from the cloned dir.

See the extensive documentation in https://cpina.github.io/push-to-another-repository-docs/ (includes examples, FAQ, troubleshooting, etc.).
